# Predicting The Functional Status of Pumps in Tanzania

Water is one of the minimum need for human beings, it is not only used for our daily needs but also for agriculture and industrial purposes. 
Though	Tanzania has access	to a lot of water, the country still faces the dilemmas of many African	countries where	many areas have	no reliable	access to water. 
We	are	looking	at the dataset	of water pumps in Tanzania to predicting the operating condition of	a water point.

### By predicting status of the functioning of pumps, the Tanzanian Ministry of Water can improve the maintenance operations of the water pumps and make sure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
